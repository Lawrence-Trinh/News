  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:
  def default_url

    0.megabytes..2.megabytes

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_whitelist
    %w(jpg jpeg png)
